    "The first two of these algorithms only differ in that uniform cost search takes account of the costs of the paths in the graph. As such we can simply implement uniform cost search, and also get breadth first search by setting all path weights to 1. \n",
    "\n",
    "A* differs from the other two in how it decides the cost of a path. A heuristic $h$ is provided that is an apriori estimate of the distance to the goal from each node. The algorithm then minimizes the sum of the path cost and this heuristic. As such we can acquire uniform cost search by setting the heuristic to zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "The search algorithm operates in the following way. We initialise a frontier as the starting node, initialise a costs dictionary storing the minimum cost from the initial node to each new node discovered, and initialise a paths dictionary storing the minimal cost path from the initial node to each newly discovered node. The algorithm proceeds by popping off nodes from the frontier with the minimal cost, and exploring the neighbours of this node, updating the costs and paths dictionaries if new nodes are discovered, or if cheaper paths are found to previously discovered nodes. The algorithm ends when the frontier is empty, though it can be terminated early if the goal node is the one popped of the frontier. The minimal path and its cost are then those stored in the paths and costs dictionaries for the goal node, if they exist, else no connection exists between the initial and goal node (e.g. from a child to a parent in a directed tree, or nodes on two separate components of a disconnected graph).\n",
    "\n",
    "I will implement the heuristic similarly to the graph. In principle we only need to define the heuristic for estimated costs to the goal node, however doing it in this way allows you to use one heuristic for finding shortest paths between multiple different nodes."
